A Vscode plugin that adds various useful features. 

## Features


### Format code blocks into snippets single-line text 

#### Problem 

Many times I would like to grab a code block on the web and add it as a vscode snippet. 
To do so, I copy the text, open snippets file, paste the text inside the body field o the snippet, then format the text line by line, either into a single line with double quotes, or add double quotes for each line. This is time consuming. 

#### Solution 

The following command
VSHelper - paste as snippets escaped text

This automatically pastes the copied text into a single line, escaped well. 
It preserves line breaks and double quotes as expected.
